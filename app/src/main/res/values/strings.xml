    <string name="not_gate_description_paragraph">‚≠ï The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, is a digital logic gate that produces an output that is the inverse of its input.
        \n‚≠ï It has only one input and one output.
        \n‚≠ï When the input is LOW (0), the output is HIGH (1), and vice versa.
        \n‚≠ï It is represented by the symbol \( \overline{A} \) or \( A\' \).
        </string>
    <string name="and_gate_description_paragraph">‚≠ï The AND gate is a digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction.
        \n‚≠ï It behaves according to the truth table where the output is true only when both inputs are true.
        \n‚≠ï It can be represented using the symbol \(&amp;\).</string>
    <string name="or_gate_description_paragraph">‚≠ï The OR gate is a digital logic gate that performs a logical OR operation.
       \n‚≠ï It has two or more inputs and one output.
       \n‚≠ï The output of an OR gate is true if any of its inputs are true. Otherwise, the output is false.</string>
    <string name="xor_gate_description_paragraph">‚≠ï The XOR gate (exclusive OR gate) is a digital logic gate that outputs true (1) only when the number of true inputs is odd.
       \n‚≠ï It behaves according to the truth table:
       \n‚≠ï The XOR gate is commonly used in various digital circuits, including adders, subtractors, and more.</string>
